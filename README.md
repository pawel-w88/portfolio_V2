## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to be accessible and look great on various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light themes to suit your preference. The theme state is managed using React Context.

- **React Router**: Utilizes React Router for navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
